# Career and Leadership Event Aggregator (Southern California)

This project uses the Meetup API to collect upcoming career and leadership-related events in Southern California. It fetches events scheduled within the next 30 days, processes the data, and outputs it into both CSV and Markdown files. 


### Technologies Used

- `requests` - sends a request to Meetup’s servers for data
- `PyJWT` - create and verify JSON Web Token in order to access the data
- `pandas`  - organize the data by turning raw event information into a clean, shareable table
- `bs4` (BeautifulSoup) - read and clean HTML content
- `markdown` – to format event data into a human-readable file.
- `datetime` – sed to convert the event's date and time from a string format to a readable format
- `time` - to get the current time in seconds for the JWT token
