**Measuring and Managing Success: For the Individual, Team, and Leadership**
Thursday July 17th, 2025 at 12:00 pm to 1:30 pm PDT
This is an online event.

Measuring UX is easier than you think. For the individual, measurement is squarely on the UX leader's shoulders. Do they have the right information from you, the team, the greater team, and know what leadership wants and needs, along with the user‚Äôs needs?

Yep, it's up to you to give them the information needed at each stage of the engagement.

Managing both up and down is an effective way to measure the team. The team needs info from leadership and the greater collaborative team.

Again, UX leadership‚Äôs job.

What about upper leadership? Knowing what they are looking for with deliverables and presentations, while also delivering both qualitative and quantitative facts. Show them, don‚Äôt tell them is key.

### Who is Carlyn Carter Wice?

‚ÄúAs-needed‚Äù HR services for your small business or non-profit. Remote-based. All industries welcome.
In the early 2000s, I taught psychology courses at community colleges and to youth at ("nerd") summer camp. After that, I worked for nine years with families and individuals as a social worker. I love both teaching and advocating for others.
In an unexpected turn of events, I became an empathetic ear, not only for the students and clients I served but for colleagues and coworkers as well. I began to see the shortcomings of academic and governmental employment and brushed up on employment law in my spare time. My passion shifted to helping burned-out employees AND the organizations that need them at their best.
During the pandemic In 2020, I pivoted my career to Human Resources from social work. Since then, I have helped nonprofits and small businesses become compliant with HR laws and regulations and build their workplace cultures. CCC started in 2023 and I could not have done It without help from professors, mentors, neighbors, friends, family, and previous employers. I hold a BA and MA in Psychology from USC and an MSHR from Pepperdine and cannot WAIT to hear YOUR story.

City: Lake Forest

Type: In-Person

Venue: South Coast Mission

Description: Narcissists can be found everywhere: in relationships, at work, amongst friends, in families or in social groups. Their narcissistic traits can be obvious or hidden. In this seminar you'll learn how to spot a narcissist, what one actually is, along with strategies to deal with or heal from them.

All true narcissists are toxic. They undermine you, make less of you and make you feel gaslighted. They can cause you to get anxious and lose confidence.

Trying to recover from a narcissistic relationship can be a journey in itself!

A narcissist uses so much emotional and verbal abuse that you‚Äôre left scarred; struggling with self-doubt. For some, a narcissistic ex can still have a hold or influence over them. They can feel compelled to reach out to them, or even accept them back.

But it‚Äôs not just in relationships. You can have narcissists in your work or in your family, busily undermining you and causing plenty of damage.
In this free seminar you will learn the real deal about narcissists and how to deal with them or recover from one. The seminar is interactive and you can get any questions you have answered.

Description: The second in the series of Getting-My-Butt-in-Gear Workshops is "Getting Organized - How to plan things out and get things done!"
For those who had attended our "Taking a Look at Our Life" workshop previously, we will be holding this one to set the stage to fully benefit from our weekly Progress Meetings.
In this workshop, we take what we have done in the first one and plan out how we want our life to unfold. While the workshops are meant to follow each other, they can be visited out of sequence. The "Taking a Look at Our Life" workshop will repeat again next month.
See you there, Werner the Organizer...

### 79. Tracking My Progress, Meeting (online)

Organizer Name: Werner

Date: Saturday, July 12, 2025

Time: 04:00 PM to 05:30 PM UTC-07:00

City: Riverside

Type: Online

Venue: No Venue

Description: It has been said that 97% of all people wait for things to happen. Sadly, those people wait a lifetime for a life worth living. I have observed that over and over again, too.

Progress Meetings are where we work on keeping our focus and energies specifically on what is important for us in our lives. During the meetings, we take a look at what we want to do or what is creating problems. And then we make goals and plans to best fit a solution to get it done.

We check in each week with a Round Robin on what we have been doing and what we plan to do, so we stay on track. These plans can be personal, business or spiritual... or all three as a person sees the need.

The Lite version is a simplified format that focuses more on the day to day activities rather than the long term planning we do at the regular meetings.

Join us Saturday afternoon 4pm, Pacific Time, to keep ourselves moving in a positive direction on the right track. Bring your schedule calendar! It is central to what we do....

We're asking for a $10 donation to help cover some of the library costs and food. Let us know when you sign up your sandwich preference.

Join us for a stimulating afternoon led by our own **Jim Watkins**, who will present *‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence: Impact on Society, Work, and Humanity.‚Äù* Jim‚Äôs talk dives into the evolution of AI from early concepts to today‚Äôs powerful language models like BERT, exploring how artificial intelligence mirrors‚Äîbut also diverges from‚Äîhuman cognition.
This presentation will serve as a springboard into an open group discussion on themes vital to Humanist ethics and values:

* What makes human understanding unique in an age of intelligent machines?
* How can we ensure AI development aligns with human well-being, autonomy, and equity?
* What are the ethical implications of pursuing Artificial General Intelligence?
* What are the ethical implications of removing the guardrails around development as the current administration is seeking to do?
* How do we maintain creativity, meaning, and social responsibility in an increasingly automated world?

**Why it matters to Humanists:**
As Humanists, we value critical thinking, scientific curiosity, ethical responsibility, lifelong learning and the dignity of all people. This conversation invites us to examine not only what AI *can* do‚Äîbut what it *should* do in a society guided by human values.
Whether you're curious about the science, concerned about the ethics, or excited about the potential, this event is for you.

Come for the presentation. Stay for the discussion. Leave with new ideas.

### 86. CATAPULT: Shadow Illusion dance performance at the Redlands Bowl.

Organizer Name: Michael

Date: Friday, July 11, 2025

Time: 07:00 PM to 10:00 PM UTC-07:00

City: Palm Springs

Type: In-Person

Venue:  Redlands bowl

Description: Please join me for what I'm sure will be an amazing performance at the Redlands Bowl.
The Redlands Bowl has provided high quality, FREE, music performances for 102 years. It is a very well funded nonprofit, so they can afford to hire the very best artists.
***Catapult*** *has captivated audiences worldwide since taking America‚Äôs Got Talent by storm in 2013. Through shadow illusion dance, you will be transported in fantastical worlds made from only light, shadow, and the human body. A Bowl evening for the entire family! [https://redlandsbowl.org/catapult](https://redlandsbowl.org/catapult)*

I think if you watch this 2 minute video you will see how inspiring this show will be live: [https://youtu.be/gjgiys6PdyM?si=bNPb5CHlBH1VTKeK](https://youtu.be/gjgiys6PdyM?si=bNPb5CHlBH1VTKeK)
I try to arrive by 6:30 pm, so I can get a seat in one of the front rows, but even if you come at 8pm, I expect there will be space on the lawns or benches. If you come early I suggest bringing a picnic dinner. The wood bench seats have backs, but you might want to bring a cushion. The music starts at 8pm and the concerts lasts about two hours.

Typically, there are some food and drinks available at concession stands at the back of the bowl. I've had no trouble finding free on street parking two or three blocks from the bowl.

Look forward to seeing you at this performance!
Michael

The answers and guidance from Light-Beings Johar and Simon, plus perhaps your personal angels and guides can bring you Real answers to your Personal part in helping the LIGHT prevail and the darkness weaken.
Remember, YOU ARE NOT ALONE! You have more power than you might think. There is a path for resolving and paving the way for a better world.
Join us for an afternoon of spiritual connection, clarity, and empowerment.

Are you working on a project, your own or a client's, and you're having some challenges? Do you have an idea for your WordPress site and you don't even know where to begin to implement it? Well, this Meetup is for you! Bring your project and we'll look at your sticky parts or help you strategize how to move forward with your ideas.

GET INSPIRED

In these interesting times getting online is essential, especially for your "non-essential" business. We can brainstorm ways to get online technically AND creatively with WordPress.

GAIN CLARITY

Sometimes knowing where to begin is just too overwhelming. When you gain more clarity and focus on what you want to achieve, it's easier to look for options. Bring your big WordPress Dreams and let's see if we can help you find the first step to implementing them.

SQUASH THE BUGS

Are you stuck? Something isn't working the way everyone else says it should. You've spent days and lost hair trying to figure it out. Maybe a few more pairs of eyes and extra brain power can help you. Bring you're buggy situations and let's see if we can fumigate your issue!

The Meetup is 2 hours long. Depending on number of participants and issues not everyone may get help for their specific issue. So, I will go in the order of RSVP's. Isn't that incentive for you to grab your spot now?...

I will help you figure out how to set up to paint En Plein Air, it's a very important class, so please attend this orientation. You will take home your borrowed special outdoor easel this night.

I teach French Impressionism. You bring your own materials (or order materials online, or buy at an art store... about $150 for what you will need). I have easels set up in the studio for you. I teach from the very beginning, the first steps and onward of the classic painting method of the French Impressionists. No experience at all is required. IF YOU HAVE NEVER ATTENDED, YOU WILL NEED SOME ORIENTATION PRIOR TO THE EVENT, so you must message me here on Meetup.

Bring wine or your favorite drink --
6:00 Dinner - People bring dishes to share
7:00 Art Class
8:45 Clean up and over by 9 ish.

IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST CLASS, PRIVATE MESSAGE ME - because I will need to get you up to speed -- since the first class is the orientation and you will have missed that. I have canvases for you to pick out and purchase, about $10 each depending on size. Bring cash. Or bring your own canvas appropriate for the dimensions/shape of the painting you want to create.

On all following classes, you will progress with your painting at your individual pace. The 2nd class is the drawing of your subject with vine charcoal, then we progress into the Prussian blue outline... there is a method I teach that helps get your painting to be a life long treasure!

The background music is soft classic rock as we paint.

The home for this NEW 2023 series of art classes is that of Patron of the Arts -- a generous gift of a good person at his amazing estate. The setting is an amazing Montecito Estate on a gorgeous property. There will be parking instructions and address to those signed up for this class.

Many of the former students love to bring a side dish! Which is always appreciated! The dinner is made by me or another member and the side dishes appear by those wanting to bring! Don't worry, you will not go hungry! If you have any dietary restrictions - plan on bringing things you can eat for yourself, because the recipes are very standard American fare.

We will sit down to dinner, all in all with my private list of past art class members there will be about 14 guests altogether. If you want to help set the table or otherwise be more involved, just let me know, it is soooooo fun! We have such a good time!

I will from time to time film these nights, and certainly do lots of social media. You can Google me to see the types of projects I'm involved with -- Rebecca Brand. Everyone that attends will need to sign a waiver for the filming (so if you are photo adverse, this is not the class for you - you don't need to pose, but incidentally you may be in a photo or video).

The art studio is in a large garage set up as an art studio. I will heat as necessary.

This is a special special group and event. I have been studying or teaching French Impressionist oil painting for over 30 years. It is my passion! I hope you may check it out! Everyone is welcome! To see my art style and work, Google: Rebecca Brand Fine Art America.

Cheers!

REPEATING EVENT -- Twice a month on Monday nights, 4:30 - 9:00.

We will meet at Butterfly Beach in Montecito to paint the landscape en plein air at 4:30 - 6:30 pm. We will each set up our easels that you will have from class 1 of this special summer series. I will then instruct onto how to capture a scene. You will already have your washed canvas. You will use soft vine charcoal to sketch a simple scene, then do your prussian blue outline, then get to painting. You will not need to finish your painting. You may take a photo of exactly your scene, then print it out to finish later at home or in the studio this fall, however you like. No pressure to finish your painting, I sure won't! The canvases will be the small ones you get from Summer Session Class 1 -- or bring your own washed canvas of any size.

At 6:30 we will pack up and go to dinner. For those attending, I will send the name of the restaurant ON MEETUP EMAIL, something casual and inexpensive. I will get a reservation for everyone. For the dinner, you may ask guests to join, just tell me how many.

BASIC INFORMATION FROM THE STUDIO CLASS:
I teach French Impressionism. You bring your own materials (or order materials online, or buy at an art store... about $150 for what you will need). I have easels set up in the studio for you. I teach from the very beginning, the first steps and onward of the classic painting method of the French Impressionists. No experience at all is required.
